Standing up for justice to make sure your friend doesn't do something illegal like stealing a shirt is good so he doesn't get in trouble, and it's good that you care about your friend enough to not want your friend to be in trouble. But publicly shaming him might only get him in trouble, and your friend might think of you as a bad person. So it's the second best choice.
