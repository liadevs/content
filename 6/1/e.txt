Ignoring a problem will not make it go away, and ignoring Irene will make her more angry. A good way is to politely ask her what is wrong, so that you can fix the problem before anything worse happens. Communication is essential for a good friendship, and this case is no exception. Joining in on the problem is not going to help with the solution. Although it may be tempting because your friend may seem to be having fun, remember that the people around you are not having a fun time and are upset when someone breaks the rules everyone is following.
