Attempting to prevent your friend from doing something illegal and harming is good since you don't want your friend to have a big problem from doing illegal things such as stealing. If your friend doesn't listen to you it's good that you accept your friend doing something illegals because at the end it is your friends choice and you can only help so much by not obsessing too much on helping, but trying your best, you can have a good friendship without being too “nosy” as people would say.
