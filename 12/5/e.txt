This answer, though good advice, isn’t the best thing to say to Bill because it may seem insensitive. Bill is still sad that he didn’t get into varsity, and feels bad about himself. Maybe try to be nicer to him, instead of bluntly telling him what he needs to do next. Most people need time to recover before they move on, and being harsh before they are ready will make them feel worse.
